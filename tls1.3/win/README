TLS Release 1.3

Before compiling check and configure the makefile for the following variables:

TCL_VERSION	= 82
TCL_ROOT	= $(SYSTEMDRIVE)\tcl$(TCL_VERSION)
TCL_LIBRARY	= "$(TCL_LIB)\tcl$(TCL_VERSION)$(DBGX).lib" 

SSL_ROOT	= e:/openssl
# Set to 0 to link against US/Patented openssl library
SSL_EXPORT	= 1
# Set to "" for dll linkage (as opposed to static)
SSL_STATIC	= s
# Uncomment if using a pre- 0.9.4 version of OpenSSL
#SSL_DEFINES	= -DPRE_OPENSSL_0_9_4


Then just "nmake" and "nmake install" should do the trick!
